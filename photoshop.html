        This year in photoshop I created my own Julie Opie inspired selfie and my own Beth Hoeckel inspired portrait.

    <img src="images/photoshop_image.PNG" style="height: 200px" alt="Photoshop Image" width="900" align="middle" padding: ;>

    <div class="text3">
        <b> These are the images I inspired my Beth Hoeckel protrait off... </b>


    </div>


    <div class= text2> I chose these images with the concept of making my landscape look supernatural. I wanted to incorporate the idea of a cave with an image of the moon, to give off the idea that someone is 'stranded' on a cave near space.

    <div class="text3" "font-size: 1.8em"><b> This is my finished Beth Hoeckel portrait.</b>


    </div>


    <div class= text2> I created this portrait using various techniques in Photoshop, including the eraser tool, move tool, transform tool and lasso tool. As you can see, I erased the original background in the cave and added my own moon and star pictures. I then added in a picture of a sillouhette to make it seem like a human is stranded on some type of supernatural cave near the moon but near water also. Lastly I adjusted the colouring (such as the exposure and saturation) of the image to match it with it's surroundings.

        <b> This is my finished Julian Opie inspired selfie.

    </div>






    <div class= text2> I created this portrait using various techniques in Photoshop, including the brush tool, paint bucket tool and picker tool. I started by outlining my original picture with the brush tool to form the base of my selfie. I then added more dimension with different thickness of lines and various colours.

    <div class= "text2"> I created this text using Photoshop. I originally made this to link it with my AR project, which you can read more about in my AR section.
