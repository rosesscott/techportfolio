    I used multiple Adobe apps such as Adobe After Effects, Adobe Animate and Adobe Media Encoder to create my own animation. I ended up rotoscoping a clip from a Twenty One Pilots music video and pairing that with my After Effects skills to create a 10 second edit.

    <div class="text3"> <b> This is my finished animation that I created using After Effects and Adobe Animate. </b>


    </div>
    <div class= "text2">



     It took me around 2 weeks to rotoscope my clip and a couple of days to edit the extra effects on After Effects. These effects included my eye drawing at the end of the edit and various overlays throughout it.

        Before I attempted at rotoscoping the 10 second clip from the Twenty One Pilots music video, I practiced rotoscoping this simple train video. This was so I could learn how to use the different techniques involved in Adobe Animate and Adobe Media Encoder. It took around a week, and it didn't turn out the best as it was only a rough practice, but It immensely helped me understand the concept of rotoscoping.

    <div class= "text2"> A key aspect of succesfully and effectively editing with mulitple Adobe apps is having a clear and strong file set up. This is my file structure, which plays a vital part of my editing routines.
