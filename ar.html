        This year I have done multiple pieces of work regarding AR. Firstly, I made my own customized Hiro business marker card. I used this personalized marker on AR.js marker generator, where I got a 3D symbol to show up. It took a couple of weeks to do this task, as i was just beginning to learn code, but it was very accomplishing once I sucessfully completed the task!

    <div class="text3"><b> This is my Hiro AR marker which I coded on brackets.</b> </div>
        
        
        <div class=text2> I created this marker using the AR.js marker generator, Brackets and Photoshop. At first my Brackets program wasnâ€™t showing the file as I was saving everything in the wrong folder. I reorganized my folder and file structure and then the file started working. It was confusing at first, as it required harder code to link my own business card to the generator. I enjoyed doing this task as I further got to practice my coding and getting used to other programs such as AR.js generator.

    <div class="text3"><b> This is my customized AR marker which I coded on brackets. </b> </div>


    <div class= text2> I created this marker also using the AR.js marker generator, Brackets and Photoshop. I linked my own design mainly using my Brackets software.
