This year in Photoshop I have completed various pieces of work, including creating a Beth Hoeckel inspired landscape and a Julian Opie inspired portrait. In my Photoshop page, multiple pieces of my work is showcased, as well as a brief explanation of how I completed that work.

This year in Animation I have completed one main project and another practice project beforehand. My finished Animation is a 10 seconds motion graphics file showcasing my skills in Animate, After Effects and Media Encoder. I practiced my rotoscoping before this with an 8 second train video. Both of these finished projects are showcased on my Animation page.
